## Web Designer & Front-end Developer

Hi, my name's Dave. I'm a Web Designer and Front-end Developer based in Bristol UK, currently working at [Stackbit](https://stackbit.com) as part of the Developer Relations team.

With over 11 years professional experience, I've been building up my skills in design, UI development, and front-end development, working with some really exciting people like [Ghost](https://ghost.org), [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/) and [BaseKit](https://basekit.com).

In my spare time, I also write [articles](https://david.darn.es) and work on [open-source projects](https://daviddarnes.github.io), such as [Anchor CMS](https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms) and [Alembic theme](https://alembic.darn.es).

If you'd like chat, [get in touch](http://enable-javascript.com/ "my email").
