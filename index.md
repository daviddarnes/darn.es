## Designer, Front-end Developer & Writer

**Hi, my name's Dave. I'm a Freelance Designer, Front-end Developer & Writer based in Bristol UK.**

With over 11 years professional experience, I've been building up my skills in design, UI development, and front-end development, working with some really exciting people like [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Ghost](https://ghost.org), [Buffer](https://buffer.com), [Formspree](https://formspree.io), [Stackbit](https://stackbit.com), [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/) and [BaseKit](https://basekit.com).

In my spare time, I also write [articles](https://david.darn.es) and work on [open-source projects](https://daviddarnes.github.io), such as [Anchor CMS](https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms) and [Alembic theme](https://alembic.darn.es).
